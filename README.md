# Simple-Expense-Tracker
The project aims to create a user-friendly Python-based application with
a simple and intuitive user interface to allow users to add and view expenses,
including the date and expense amount. It will enable users to view their
expense history in a structured format and store expense data in an 
Excel spreadsheet for easy access and management, simplifying the process of
tracking daily expenses for individuals seeking a straightforward financial
management solution.
